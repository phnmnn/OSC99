It is over the top messy right now. My next step is to clean it up. I didnt plan on spending so much time on it when I started.
I have never made anything near this big. 

In order to run it you have to download and install Processing and the ControlP5 library within it.
Processing is free and open source and can be downloaded here:
https://processing.org/
Once Processing is open install P5 by clicking on "Tools" and then "Add Tool."
Then click on "Libraries" and then search for "ControlP5."

It uses sin wave values stored in an array to fill in the pixels accordingly. 

Naivagate the 3 menus by using the slider in the top left corner.
Try out the 'Randomize' parameter in the "Main" menu.

Because of how I used blending modes sometimes depending on the settings you choose the text and UI both go black.
It is still functional when this happens. Im working on fixing it. 

There should be a folder called "output" within the project folder that you download, but idk how to get a blank folder on here.
This folder is where your exported/rendered frames will be saved. If you dont want to create it yourself it should create it for you once you actually render. 
Save frames by clicking the button in the top right corner.

Several of the paremeters are labled "empty" and just for temporary placement. 

The newer version allows you to save and load presets. In the "Main" menu you can click "Save Patch" and all the values for each parameter will be stored in a human readable json file. Click "Load Patch" and select a json file to load it in. I have included several preset files in the newer version.
